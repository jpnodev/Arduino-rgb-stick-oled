# Arduino-rgb-stick
An rgb led controlled with a joystick and an spi oled screen
AdaFruit librairies needs to be installed to draw on the oled screen.
The screen displays the RGB components.
They can be changed with the three sliders.
Each color is stored in an 8bit integer and is then mapped to a tension with an 'analogWrite();'.
